# line-following-vroomba

## Description 

Developed a line following robot using the Roomba 675 platform. Stripping the entire robot except its wheels, I was able to interface my own microcontroller, IR sensors, and motor drivers to have the robot navigate through the course. 

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano
- Sunfounder 8-Channel Line Follower Module
- L298N Motor Driver
- LM2596 DC-DC Converter
